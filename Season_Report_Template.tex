% Group addresses by affiliation; use superscriptaddress for long
% author lists, or if there are many overlapping affiliations.
% For Phys. Rev. appearance, change preprint to twocolumn.
% Choose pra, prb, prc, prd, pre, prl, prstab, or rmp for journal
%  Add 'draft' option to mark overfull boxes with black boxes
%  Add 'showpacs' option to make PACS codes appear

\hypertarget{r-markdown}{%
\subsection{R Markdown}\label{r-markdown}}

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see \url{http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com}. \cite{1}

When you click the \textbf{Knit} button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{summary}\NormalTok{(cars)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
##      speed           dist       
##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{including-plots}{%
\subsection{Including Plots}\label{including-plots}}

You can also embed plots, for example:

\includegraphics{Season_Report_Template_files/figure-latex/pressure-1.pdf}

Note that the \texttt{echo\ =\ FALSE} parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
